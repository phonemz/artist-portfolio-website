                    Her favorite food is mountain yams.
                    She has never received a perfect score on a test.
                    She can run 50 meters in 8.7 seconds.

                    Her members compare her to a basilisk and a crab.  However, KANON says she is a completely new species of animal.
                    Her ideal boyfriend is someone with attractive eyes.
